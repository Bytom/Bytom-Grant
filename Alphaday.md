### Project Introduction
Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 


Market research we conducted in 2021 concluded that crypto users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community. 
We would like to create a Bytom ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

- The latest Bytom official announcements and blog post content
- A feed of all news mentions of Bytom from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet
- A calendar containing all Bytom events including Bytom meetups, hackathons with Bytom bounties, AMAs
- Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Bytom team members
- Youtube stream containing educational Bytom content.
- Bytom Document directory
- Integration with Bytom Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics
- Discord & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions
- FAQ, Whitepaper, BTM tokenomics information
- Bytom Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed 
- Bytom Developer Center
- A widget featuring the Bytom roadmap with all the descriptions and links included
- Widgets dedicated to Bytom ecology, Wallets, Browsers, Projects and Partners

### Roadmap
• We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Bytom dashboard by March 2023. We will require 1,200 USD upfront costs for development including integrating the discussion forums, blog post, social feed, jobs listing and partnerships. \
• 120 USD per month for 12 months for maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest Bytom events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates not automatically captured by the Alphaday aggregator engine is manually added to the board, and other maintenance tasks. 
### Future Plan 
Once we’ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that Bytom stakeholders truly love to use.
